## 1. Project

### 1.1. Project Management Process

Here we outline the main activities in a non-necessary sequential order:

1. When a project is started the first step is to assemble the team in a slack dedicated project channel. Project Channel names start with a double hyphen “--”. Example: “--awaken-flow”, “--c2g”
2. The Project folder must be created under the main “Projects” folder managed by the organization. (Google Drive)
3. Infrastructure Provisioning: Servers, 8base workspace, hosting, GitHub, slack channel, buddy works, DNS setup, etc
4. Subscribe Github notifications to Slack Channel
5. The full scope of the project must be shared with the Development Team to create an Execution Plan if necessary.
6. The repositories for different pieces of the project must be created on Github and the members of the Development team must be provided with access to them.
7. Set Fisherman (activity Tracking for developers) for the project’s repositories tracking and standups.
8. The Kanban has to be set in one of the projects. 
9. The milestones and deliverables both internal (if exist) and external must be created in the Kanban along with the User Stories.
10. All User Stories (Issues or Tickets) must be bound to a milestone of the project.
11. Set the times for the Planning meeting and the daily standups with the development team.
12. Set the communication channels with the Customer.
13. Kickoff meeting with the Development Team.
14. Ensure that all requirements for the full development of the project are in place or scheduled to be in place. 

### 1.2 Project Planning Meeting

### 1.3. Client Feedback Spreadsheet:
 
 TODO: 
 
## 2. Quality Assurance:

### 2.1. Issues Quality Test:

Ticket specification is responsabilitye of the Project Manager, QA and Technical Lead.

- If the Issue is estimated to be longer than 2 days, it needs to be split.
- If the Issue doesn't have the specification completed, it needs to be completed.
- If the Issue doesn't have the technical specification completed, it needs to be completed.
- If the Issue requires a UI and it doesn't have it 

### 2.2. Test Case
