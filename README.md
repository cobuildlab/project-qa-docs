### 1.1. Project Management Process

Here we outline the main activities when starting a project in a non-necessary sequential order:

1. When a project is started the first step is to assemble the team in a slack dedicated project channel. Project Channel names start with a double hyphen “--”. Example: “--awaken-flow”, “--c2g”
2. The Project folder must be created under the main “Projects” folder managed by the organization. (Google Drive)
3. Infrastructure Provisioning: Servers, 8base workspace, hosting, GitHub, slack channel, buddy works, DNS setup, etc
4. Set Github Kanban with columns and labels
5. Subscribe Github notifications to Slack Channel
6. The full scope of the project must be shared with the Development Team to create an Execution Plan with milestones and deliverables.
7. Create Milestones in Github Project Kanban
8. Provide access to the team members to the Github repositiories, Project Folder and any other external assets (Invision, XD, Auth0, AWS, Buddy works, etc)
9. Set Fisherman (activity Tracking for developers) for the project’s repositories tracking and standups.
10. Complete all User Stories (Issues or Tickets) in the project scope on a Planning meeting.
11. Set the meetings for the Planning and Daily Standups with the development team.
12. Set the communication channels with the Customer.
